# DOM-part1

Thanks to this exercise, have a much better understanding of DOM in 
JavaScript.  It has also helped me gain a better understanding of 
the many uses available regarding for loops. I canalso make better use 
of variables to even manipulate styles in Vanilla JavaScript.   I look 
forward to moving on to Part 2 of Traversy Media JavaScript series.
